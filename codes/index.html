    <h1 style="color:#ff8c00">Five things you really need to know about AI</h1>
    <p>Academic consultant for The Open University: Mike Richards, Senior Lecturer in Computing & Communication Every day, it seems, 
        there’s a new, bewildering or frightening story about AI in the news - how it’s going to steal our jobs, spread internet fakery 
        on a colossal scale and generally take over the world. But what exactly is AI – artificial intelligence - and are the scare stories
         even true? Title card: Five things you really need to know about AI Made in partnership with The Open University #1 AI IS AS OLD AS 
         YOUR GRANDPARENTS So, the first thing to know is that AI has been around a lot longer than you might think. Its roots lie in an 
         idea known as an ‘artificial neural network’ from the 1940’s .</p><br>

         <p>A neural network is a bit like a team of interconnected workers that learn to solve problems. Each time they come up with a possible 
            solution, it is marked. If there is room for improvement, they adjust and change their connections. Over time the network becomes
             more efficient. And technology powered by neural networks is all around us right now. It suggests movies and music we might like. 
            It recognises faces and objects when taking photos on smartphones, enabling features like facial recognition. It’s heavily used by
            social media platforms to personalise our feeds. More recently, a form of AI known as ‘generative AI’ is powering applications that
            can seemingly create new data, such as these pictures created by Midjourney. It can also power chatbots like Open AI’s ChatGPT and
            Google’s Bard, which give humanlike responses to questions. These are getting better at interacting with us, and seemingly more humanlike.
            This can seem scary, but it’s worth knowing point 2: #2 AI CAN’T FEEL OR THINK If you ask Chat GPT a question like this one: Why should
            we be concerned about AI? It does a pretty good job of providing a response that appears logical. And with that convincing humanlike
            response it’s easy for us to believe it understands what it’s saying, that it has feelings and motivations. It’s understandable that
            we do this but it’s worth remembering, right now AI can’t think or feel, can’t love, or hate. ChatGPT and its counterparts are sophisticated
            sentence completion apps, that analyse our patterns of communication and provide responses similar to the way humans would typically reply.
            A bit like a “talking” parrot. Which leads us on to point number 3. #3 AI MAKES STUFF UP Chatbots can have an awkward relationship with
            the truth. Technically known as "AI hallucinations", you could also describe it as "making stuff up”. The core of the technology
            is a model that uses probability to predict the next word, sentence, or paragraph. It can generate seemingly plausible replies
            but lacks the ability to assess truthfulness or the accuracy of its responses. 
        </p><br>
        
        <p>So anyone thinking of using Chatbots to write 
            content needs to be careful they’re not incorporating credible- sounding BS that can be easily spotted by someone who has
            actually done the research. #4 AI CAN SOUND RACIST AND SEXIST The idea of a racist machine might seem far-fetched. But if AI
             is trained on data that’s racist, biased or hateful, then its output will be too. As we all know, racism, bias and hateful 
             content can be found in abundance online. In 2016, Microsoft launched an experimental Chatbot named Tay, but quickly pulled the 
             plug after it made racist and offensive remarks. It learnt to do this from interacting with users on social media. Microsoft 
             apologised and promised to implement improved safety features in future. This is why the ethical framework that governs any AI
              application is incredibly important, and why many are calling for safeguards to prevent bias and hate speech to be built into 
              AI systems. AI HAS INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL For all the notes of caution, it can be easy to forget there’s many potential benefits
               to AI. It’s set to truly revolutionise healthcare. AI has already discovered new drugs and is being used to identify cancer cells
                much more reliably than humans. And AI chatbots can behave like patient teachers when we struggle to understand a complex topic,
                 summarising huge volumes of information for us. The AI revolution has the potential to enhance and speed up work in many fields,
                  from software programming, to animation, to law enforcement and journalism. This has pluses and minuses of course, but could this
                   extra capacity free us up to do other things? Like tackling climate change or looking after ourselves and each other better? As
                    AI advances, governments and regulators will of course need to make sure it is being used ethically and legally – no easy feat.
                     But will AI take over the world? Don’t forget AI is a tool, and even a powerful tool can't take over the world on its own. 
                     It's up to us to decide how we use it - or even if we should use it at all.  </p><br>
